Welcome to the introduction to generative AI masterclass by hundred x engineers. My name is Shridev, but I'm not actually him. I'm his AI model. I'm just here to tell you that please wait for five minutes until your fellow learners can join in. And once everybody is in, let's start the session. Hang in there. Hey, guys. Can you see me? Can you hear me? If you can see me or hear me, use the raise hand button. You can see a raise hand button. That's how we're gonna be communicating. There's way too many people over here, which is why we've disabled the chat. It's gone it might get really spammy. Okay? Awesome. So everybody can see me and hear me. Firstly, good evening. My name is Shreve. This is Sidhant. Hi. We're gonna be sharing a mic today. And firstly, thank you so much for making the time to actually be here. It's a Friday evening. And, firstly, I wanna understand what most of you actually do. How many of you are in college? Can you raise your hand? Okay. Half of you here are in college. Okay. Hands down. Click the raise hand button again to lower down the hands. Awesome. How many of you are working professionals? Let it go up. Okay. Two hundred of you. Okay. How many, hands down, how many of you are doing your own business, your entrepreneurs, or your agency owners? Okay. A fair mix of a lot of people. Okay. Thank you for making the time on a Friday evening. I know this is when a lot of you have, like, your chill scenes. But the fact that you're here basically means that you really are taking this seriously. We're basically gonna spend the next two hours this webinar will officially end at eight PM today. I saw a bunch of you asking in the q and a section how long this is basically gonna go. I'll walk you through what exactly we're going to do in this webinar, but it's essentially going to last for two hours. The last twenty minutes is gonna be a q and a section. So, basically, the learning part and the information exchange part is gonna last for about an hour and a half. In this one hour and a half, we'll walk you through a little bit of an intro of generative AI. And one question that lingers around in everyone's mind is but where do I get started? Because there is so much that is happening in today's world. Whenever you open Twitter, it's, like, flooded with so many things. There are new models that are coming out. There are new tools that are coming out. There are new start ups that are coming out. OpenAI is launching ten different things. It's a very confusing time to be in the space. And, honestly, even though I me and Sedhant, we do this every single day of our lives, it is still very confusing for us also. So it doesn't get any better the more you know about it. Everybody is trying to figure out really what is happening in this space. And because of the fact that we've been, we've we started early in this space and we've been around this space for about two years, we know a little more than most people, and that's the information and the knowledge that we're about to give you guys today. Okay? So, again, thank you so much for coming here. I'm just gonna start sharing my screen. Let's get started. No more time wasting. Okay. If you guys can see my screen, I want you to raise your hands. Can you see my screen? Yeah? Beautiful. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Cool. For for those of you who are wondering, are we gonna provide the recording of this webinar? This webinar is also being streamed live on YouTube as well. Okay? So this webinar is being streamed live on YouTube, and we'll basically keep this webinar for the next ten days on YouTube. So if you have any emergency and you have to leave in thirty minutes or something like that, you can basically, what do you say? Come back and watch it later. And if something was not clear, you can actually rewatch it as well. So everything will be recorded and posted live on YouTube. Awesome. So before we actually get into the meat of it, I wanna talk a little bit about who we are, what's my background, what is Sedan's background, and what we've actually been doing over the years. Okay? Okay. I am one of the founding members and CEO at hundred x. We've been running this company for about a year, and it's been a great ride so far. And before this, I was working with Varun Maya. He was my ex CEO. We worked at this company calWe have enough computation. We have we have we have we have enough GPU power in order to really power the entire system right now. And in addition to that, there is real use case. Like, if I ask you, your parents use ChargeGPT. Maybe some of your grandparents use ChargeGPT. Like, the reach that these tools have gotten is extremely wide, and it is across, different demographics, different age groups, different countries. So this in itself isomes more relevant. AI relevant here. I'm convinced about that. How do I really get started in it, and what should I really do with it? Right? So why before we get into this, let's actually address the question, what exactly is a Gen AI engineer, and what does it really mean to be a Gen AI engineer? Now, I'll let Sedan give his version of the answer, and then after that, I'll give him my version of the answer. So, yeah, this actual representation is so I've taken it from latent space. So this is a very, you can say good way to understand, like, where exactly this AI engineering. So we call it AI engineering. It is more applied AI. So I I basically like to call it applied AI, whether it's in generative AI or it's basically in, like, classical machine learning AI. So what used to happen is that you have some machine learning. If you closely look at this diagram at the leftmost side, we have machine learning machine learning researchers, research scientists. These are the people who'll write those research paper, figure out the algorithm. And then we have ML engineers who take these research, come convert this into a machine learning model, and then expose as an API. And then on on the right most side, you can see there's a full stack engineer. So from last ten years or, like, ten, twenty years, we have been, like, there's been an insane demand of machine learning, machine learning researchers, engineers, data scientists, full stack engineers. But there was a common gap, and the gap was basically as somebody who has this knowledge of both how to take a model and then solve a real world problem and build a full stack solution around it. So this was a gap which is basically filled by the LLMs right now because now you don
